# Sieve Roadmap

Native connectors add first-class policy rules, operation-level controls, and a better setup UX over the generic HTTP Proxy / MCP Proxy connectors, which remain the fallback for any service not yet listed as shipped below.

## Shipped

Implemented in `internal/connectors/`:

- **GitHub** (`github/`)
- **GitLab** (`gitlab/`)
- **Linear** (`linear/`)
- **Notion** (`notion/`)
- **Asana** (`asana/`)
- **Slack** (`slack/`) — bot and user token install; see `docs/connectors-slack.md`.
- **Gmail** (`gmail/`)
- **Anthropic** (`anthropic/`) — LLM API connector.
- **HTTP Proxy** (`httpproxy/`) — generic connector for any HTTP API.
- **MCP Proxy** (`mcpproxy/`) — generic connector for any MCP server.

## Planned

- [ ] **Jira** — Issues, sprints, boards, JQL search. OAuth or API token. Policy rules: project scope, issue type filters, transition restrictions.
- [ ] **Discord** — Messages, channels, guilds, reactions. Bot token. Policy rules: guild scope, channel restrictions, no DMs.
- [ ] **Microsoft Teams** — Messages, channels, chats. Microsoft Graph API. Policy rules: team scope, read-only channels.
- [ ] **Microsoft 365** — Outlook (email), OneDrive (files), SharePoint (docs), Teams. Microsoft Graph API with OAuth. Policy rules mirror Google services: email read-only, file access by folder, calendar restrictions.
- [ ] **PostgreSQL** — Direct SQL queries with policy-enforced row-level security. Connection via connection string. Policy rules: table allowlist, read-only, query complexity limits, result row limits.
- [ ] **MySQL** — Same model as PostgreSQL.
- [ ] **Snowflake** — Warehouse queries. Policy rules: schema/table scope, query cost limits.
- [ ] **BigQuery** — Google Cloud analytics. Policy rules: dataset scope, query byte limits.
- [ ] **Stripe** — Customers, payments, subscriptions, invoices. API key auth. Policy rules: read-only, no refunds, amount limits, customer scope.
- [ ] **Twilio** — SMS, voice calls, WhatsApp. API key auth. Policy rules: recipient allowlist, message content filters, no voice calls.
- [ ] **AWS** — Compute, storage, and managed services via IAM credentials. Policy rules: service allowlist, resource ARN scope, read-only, region limits.
- [ ] **GCP** — Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, BigQuery, Cloud Run. Service account auth. Policy rules: project scope, resource type restrictions, region limits.
- [ ] **Azure** — VMs, Blob Storage, Cosmos DB. Service principal auth. Policy rules: resource group scope, read-only, region limits.
- [ ] **Vercel** — Deployments, domains, environment variables. API token auth. Policy rules: project scope, no production deploys, read-only env vars.
- [ ] **Cloudflare** — DNS, Workers, Pages, WAF. API token auth. Policy rules: zone scope, read-only DNS, no WAF changes.

## Security Priority

Native connectors are prioritized by:
1. How commonly AI agents need the service
2. How dangerous unrestricted access is (email > file storage > read-only APIs)
3. How much policy granularity improves over the generic proxy
