# Setting Up Connections

This guide walks through setting up every connection type in Sieve. Connections hold the real credentials for external services. Agents never see these credentials -- they use scoped Sieve tokens instead.

All connection setup happens in the Sieve web UI at `https://localhost:19816/connections`.

> **Prerequisite:** Sieve must be unlocked before you can save a connection. On first startup you set a passphrase; on every restart you re-enter it. The passphrase derives the encryption key that protects every stored credential. If the UI returns `503 service locked`, Sieve is running without a passphrase source -- see [credential-encryption.md](credential-encryption.md).

## Google Account

A single Google connection provides access to six services: Gmail, Drive, Calendar, Contacts (People API), Sheets, and Docs -- over 35 operations total. Policies control which operations the agent can use.

### Prerequisites

- A Google Cloud project with OAuth 2.0 credentials (client ID and client secret).
- The OAuth consent screen configured with the necessary scopes.

If you have not set up Google OAuth credentials yet, follow the [Google OAuth setup guide](google-oauth-setup.md) for a step-by-step walkthrough.

### Setup steps

1. Open `https://localhost:19816/connections`.
2. Under the **Google** category, find the **Google Account** card.
3. Enter a **Connection Alias** (e.g., `work`). This is how agents and API paths will reference this connection.
4. Enter a **Display Name** (e.g., "Work Gmail"). This is shown in the Sieve UI.
5. Click **Connect Google Account**.
6. You will be redirected to Google's OAuth consent screen. Sign in with the Google account you want to connect and grant the requested permissions.
7. After completing OAuth, you are redirected back to Sieve. The connection appears in the Active Connections table.

### What you get

One row in the Active Connections table showing:

| Alias | Service | Display Name | Added |
|-------|---------|--------------|-------|
| work  | google  | Work Gmail   | just now |

The agent can now use any of these operations (subject to policies):

- **Gmail**: list_emails, read_email, read_thread, create_draft, update_draft, send_email, send_draft, reply, add_label, remove_label, archive, list_labels, get_attachment
- **Drive**: drive.list_files, drive.get_file, drive.download_file, drive.upload_file, drive.share_file
- **Calendar**: calendar.list_events, calendar.get_event, calendar.create_event, calendar.update_event, calendar.delete_event
- **People**: people.list_contacts, people.get_contact, people.create_contact, people.update_contact, people.delete_contact
- **Sheets**: sheets.get_spreadsheet, sheets.read_range, sheets.write_range, sheets.create_spreadsheet
- **Docs**: docs.get_document, docs.list_documents, docs.create_document, docs.update_document

### How the agent accesses it

**Via MCP:** Tools appear as `list_emails`, `drive_list_files`, `calendar_create_event`, etc. (dots replaced with underscores). With multiple Google connections, tools are prefixed: `work_list_emails`, `personal_list_emails`.

**Via Gmail REST API:** Use the connection alias as the userId in the path:
```
GET /gmail/v1/users/work/messages       # "work" connection
GET /gmail/v1/users/personal/messages   # "personal" connection
GET /gmail/v1/users/me/messages         # default (first) connection
```

### Multi-account

Add multiple Google connections with different aliases. For example, `work` for your work account and `personal` for your personal account. Each goes through its own OAuth flow and holds its own credentials. You can apply different policies to each in the same role.

## LLM Providers

LLM provider connections are HTTP proxy connections with pre-configured target URLs and auth headers. The agent sends requests through Sieve; Sieve swaps the token for the real API key.

### Anthropic (Claude)

1. Go to `https://localhost:19816/connections`.
2. Under **LLM Providers**, find the **Anthropic (Claude)** card.
3. Enter a **Connection Alias** (e.g., `anthropic`).
4. Enter a **Display Name** (e.g., "Claude").
5. Enter your **API Key** (starts with `sk-ant-api03-...`). Get one at [console.anthropic.com/settings/keys](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys).
6. Click **Connect Anthropic**.

What is created: an HTTP proxy connection with target `https://api.anthropic.com`, auth header `x-api-key`, and extra headers `anthropic-version: 2023-06-01` and `content-type: application/json`.

**Agent access via proxy:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:19817/proxy/anthropic/v1/messages \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sieve_tok_xxxxx" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

### OpenAI

1. Under **LLM Providers**, find the **OpenAI** card.
2. Enter alias (e.g., `openai`), display name (e.g., "OpenAI"), and API key.
3. The API key must include the `Bearer ` prefix (e.g., `Bearer sk-proj-...`). Get one at [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
4. Click **Connect OpenAI**.

What is created: an HTTP proxy to `https://api.openai.com` with auth header `Authorization`.

**Agent access via proxy:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:19817/proxy/openai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sieve_tok_xxxxx" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4o","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}]}'
```

### Gemini (Google)

1. Under **LLM Providers**, find the **Gemini (Google)** card.
2. Enter alias (e.g., `gemini`), display name (e.g., "Gemini"), and API key (starts with `AIza...`). Get one at [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).
3. Click **Connect Gemini**.

What is created: an HTTP proxy to `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com` with auth header `x-goog-api-key`.

**Agent access via proxy:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:19817/proxy/gemini/v1beta/models/gemini-pro:generateContent \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sieve_tok_xxxxx" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Hello"}]}]}'
```

### AWS Bedrock

1. Under **LLM Providers**, find the **AWS Bedrock** card.
2. Enter a **Connection Alias** (e.g., `bedrock`) and **Display Name** (e.g., "Bedrock").
3. Enter the **Bedrock Endpoint URL** (e.g., `https://bedrock-runtime.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`).
4. Enter your **AWS Access Key ID** (starts with `AKIA...`).
5. Enter your **AWS Secret Access Key**.
6. Enter the **Region** (e.g., `us-east-1`).
7. Click **Connect Bedrock**.

Prerequisites: An IAM user or role with the `bedrock:InvokeModel` permission. See [AWS Bedrock docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/getting-started.html).

What is created: an HTTP proxy to your Bedrock endpoint with auth header `Authorization` and extra headers `content-type: application/json`.

### OpenAI-Compatible (Ollama, Together AI, Groq)

For self-hosted models or alternative providers that use the OpenAI-compatible API format.

1. Under **LLM Providers**, find the **OpenAI-Compatible** card.
2. Enter alias (e.g., `ollama`), display name (e.g., "Ollama").
3. Enter the **Base URL** (e.g., `http://localhost:11434/v1` for Ollama, `https://api.together.xyz/v1` for Together AI, `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1` for Groq).
4. Enter an **API Key** if required (include the `Bearer ` prefix). For local Ollama, you can leave this empty.
5. Click **Connect Endpoint**.

What is created: an HTTP proxy to your specified endpoint with auth header `Authorization`.

## Cloud Providers

### AWS Account

For general AWS service access (S3, Lambda, DynamoDB, SES, EC2, and more).

1. Go to `https://localhost:19816/connections`.
2. Under **Cloud**, find the **AWS Account** card.
3. Enter a **Connection Alias** (e.g., `aws-prod`).
4. Enter a **Display Name** (e.g., "AWS Production").
5. Enter the **Default Region** (e.g., `us-east-1`).
6. Enter your **AWS Access Key ID** (starts with `AKIA...`).
7. Enter your **AWS Secret Access Key**.
8. Click **Connect AWS**.

Prerequisites: IAM credentials with permissions for the AWS services you want to use. See [AWS IAM docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html).

What is created: an HTTP proxy connection with the region as the target URL and auth header `X-Sieve-Aws-Auth`. Sieve handles AWS auth signing internally.

**Agent access:** Agents interact with AWS services through MCP tools (e.g., `ec2.run_instances`, `s3.list_objects`, `lambda.invoke`) or via the HTTP proxy. Policies can restrict which AWS services, regions, instance types, and resources the agent can access.

### Hyperstack

For GPU cloud VMs (NVIDIA H100, A100, L40S).

1. Under **Cloud**, find the **Hyperstack** card.
2. Enter alias (e.g., `hyperstack`), display name (e.g., "Hyperstack GPU").
3. Enter your **API Key**. Get one from the [Hyperstack dashboard](https://infrahub.nexgencloud.com/).
4. Click **Connect Hyperstack**.

What is created: an HTTP proxy to `https://infrahub-api.nexgencloud.com` with auth header `api_key`.

**Agent access:** Available operations include hyperstack.list_vms, hyperstack.get_vm, hyperstack.create_vm, hyperstack.delete_vm, hyperstack.start_vm, hyperstack.stop_vm, hyperstack.restart_vm, hyperstack.list_flavors, hyperstack.list_images.

## Generic HTTP Proxy

For any HTTP API not covered by the specific cards above (Stripe, Twilio, GitHub, internal APIs, etc.).

1. Under the **Generic** category, find the **HTTP Proxy** card.
2. Enter a **Connection Alias** (e.g., `stripe`).
3. Enter a **Display Name** (e.g., "Stripe API").
4. Enter the **Target Base URL** (e.g., `https://api.stripe.com`).
5. Enter the **Auth Header Name** (e.g., `Authorization`).
6. Enter the **Auth Value** -- your real API key or token (e.g., `Bearer sk_live_...`).
7. Click **Connect HTTP Proxy**.

### How it works

Sieve acts as a transparent proxy. When the agent sends a request to `http://localhost:19817/proxy/{alias}/any/path`, Sieve:

1. Validates the agent's Sieve token.
2. Evaluates policies (pre-execution).
3. Strips the agent's `Authorization` header.
4. Injects the real auth credential (the auth value you configured) into the configured auth header.
5. Forwards the request to `{target_url}/any/path`.
6. Returns the response (after post-execution policy filtering).

The agent never sees the real API key.

### Agent access

```bash
# Example: Stripe via Sieve
curl http://localhost:19817/proxy/stripe/v1/charges \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sieve_tok_xxxxx"

# Example: Twilio via Sieve
curl http://localhost:19817/proxy/twilio/2010-04-01/Accounts.json \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sieve_tok_xxxxx"
```

### Streaming responses and `auth_value_scrub`

Every HTTP Proxy connection has an `auth_value_scrub` setting (on by
default, editable from the connection's edit page). When enabled, Sieve
buffers the **entire** upstream response body so it can redact the real
credential before it reaches the agent (in case the target API ever echoes
the key back, e.g. in an error message).

This buffering means a streaming upstream response (SSE, chunked
transfer, or any other incrementally-delivered body) is delivered to the
agent as a single burst only after the full response has arrived, not
incrementally. If you're proxying a streaming API (e.g. an LLM provider's
`stream: true` endpoint) and the agent appears to hang until the whole
response completes, this is why. Sieve logs a one-line warning to the
server log whenever a connection is saved with `auth_value_scrub` enabled,
naming the connection. Turn it off on the connection's edit page if you
need low-latency streaming and accept the (small) risk of an echoed
credential reaching the agent unredacted.

### Connection table entry

| Alias  | Service    | Display Name | Added    |
|--------|------------|--------------|----------|
| stripe | http_proxy | Stripe API   | just now |

## Generic MCP Proxy

For wrapping an existing MCP server with Sieve's policy pipeline.

1. Under the catalog, find the **MCP Proxy** card.
2. Enter a **Connection Alias** (e.g., `db-tools`).
3. Enter a **Display Name** (e.g., "Database Tools").
4. Enter the **MCP Server URL** -- the upstream MCP server's endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/mcp`).
5. Optionally enter an **Auth Header** and **Auth Value** if the upstream server requires authentication.
6. Optionally enter a **Server Name** for display purposes.
7. Click **Connect MCP Proxy**.

### How it works

When the connection is created, Sieve connects to the upstream MCP server, sends an `initialize` handshake, and calls `tools/list` to discover all available tools. These tools are then exposed to agents through Sieve's MCP interface, with every tool call passing through the policy pipeline.

For example, if the upstream server exposes tools `query_database` and `create_table`, agents will see those tools in their `tools/list` response (subject to policies). When the agent calls `query_database`, Sieve evaluates policies first, then forwards the call to the upstream server via JSON-RPC.

### Agent access

Tools from the upstream server appear alongside other tools in the agent's MCP `tools/list` response. The agent calls them like any other MCP tool -- it does not need to know that Sieve is proxying to an upstream server.

With multiple MCP proxy connections, tool names are prefixed with the connection alias to avoid collisions: `db-tools_query_database`, `fs-tools_read_file`.

### Connection table entry

| Alias    | Service   | Display Name   | Added    |
|----------|-----------|----------------|----------|
| db-tools | mcp_proxy | Database Tools | just now |

## Slack Workspace

A Slack connection lets agents read and write to one Slack workspace under policy control. The full walkthrough including required bot scopes, troubleshooting, and the rationale behind the v1 limitations lives in [`connectors-slack.md`](connectors-slack.md); this section is the quick reference for the connections page.

### Prerequisites

- A Slack workspace where you can install apps.
- A Slack app at <https://api.slack.com/apps> (yours, not a third party's). Note the Client ID and Client Secret from **Basic Information**.

### Setup steps — OAuth install (recommended)

1. Set Slack OAuth credentials in Sieve's environment before starting:

   ```bash
   export SLACK_CLIENT_ID="…"
   export SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET="…"
   ```

2. In your Slack app's **OAuth & Permissions** page, add the bot scopes:

   ```
   channels:read groups:read users:read users.profile:read
   channels:history groups:history chat:write
   ```

3. Add the redirect URL `http://<your-sieve-host>:19816/oauth/callback`.
4. In Sieve's Connections page, pick **Slack** → **Install via OAuth** → approve in Slack.
5. The connection lands with `status: active` and the bot token is encrypted at rest.

### Setup steps — direct bot-token entry

1. From your Slack app's **OAuth & Permissions** page, copy the bot token (`xoxb-…`).
2. In Sieve, **Add Connection** → **Slack** → **Use existing bot token**. Paste the token and submit.
3. Sieve calls `auth.test`; on success the connection lands `active`.

### Bot vs. user identity

A Slack connection has one of two identities, set at install:

- **Bot** (default, `auth_kind` `oauth`/`token`, `xoxb-` token) — acts as the app's bot user; sees only channels it's invited to; cannot search.
- **User** (`auth_kind` `user_token`, `xoxp-`/`xoxe.` token) — acts as the installing human with their full reach (every channel/DM they can see) and can run `search_messages`.

Install a user identity via **Install via OAuth (as user)** (requests user scopes incl. `search:read`) or **Add via user token** (paste an `xoxp-…` User OAuth Token). Bot remains the least-privilege default; the full walkthrough is in [`connectors-slack.md`](connectors-slack.md).

### What you get

Curated operations exposed to agents (subject to policies):

- **list_channels** — list workspace channels (public, private, MPIM, IM)
- **list_users** — list workspace members
- **read_user_profile** — get profile info for a user
- **read_channel_history** — recent messages in a channel
- **read_thread** — replies under a parent message
- **post_message** — post a message to a channel
- **search_messages** — *user-token connections only* — bot connections return `operation_not_enabled`

All `list_*` operations use Sieve's normalized `{items, next_cursor}` pagination shape. Pass `cursor` and optional `page_size` (default 100, max 100) to walk past the first page.

### How the agent accesses it

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:19817/api/v1/connections/<alias>/ops/list_channels \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sieve_tok_…" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"page_size": 5}'
```

If the token has only one connection, MCP tools are exposed unprefixed (`list_channels`); with multiple connections, the connection alias is prefixed (`acme-slack_list_channels`).

### Connection table entry

| Alias       | Service | Display Name | Status | Added    |
|-------------|---------|--------------|--------|----------|
| acme-slack  | slack   | Acme Workspace | Active | just now |

### Status lifecycle

- **active** — healthy, agents can call operations.
- **reauth_required** — Slack returned a terminal-auth error (token revoked, app uninstalled, account deactivated). Click **Re-install** on the row to clear by completing OAuth, or paste a fresh bot token via the reauth form.
- **disabled** — admin clicked **Disable**. Cleared only by clicking **Enable**; OAuth re-install does NOT clear it.

When status is non-active, agent calls fail fast with HTTP 403 `{"error": "reauth_required" | "disabled", ...}` (REST) or `IsError` with text prefixed `reauth_required:` / `disabled:` (MCP). The upstream call is never made.

### Multi-workspace

Add a second Slack connection with a different alias (e.g., `acme-slack` and `engineering-slack`). Agents address each by alias on the agent-facing surface, and the MCP tool prefix disambiguates per-connection automatically.

### Limitations (v1)

- `search_messages` runs on **user-token** connections only — Slack's `search.*` API rejects bot tokens. On a bot connection it returns `{"error": "operation_not_enabled", ...}`; the op stays grantable against either kind so a role's grant is stable across re-auth.
- No Slack Enterprise Grid org-level installs.
- No inbound webhooks (Slack Events API). Sieve is outbound-only; agents poll `read_channel_history` for event-driven workflows.
- No granular-scope token rotation. Slack tokens (bot and user) are classic non-rotating.

## After creating a connection

Creating a connection makes it available in Sieve, but agents cannot use it until you:

1. **Create a policy** (or use a built-in preset) that defines what operations are allowed.
2. **Create a role** that pairs the connection with one or more policies.
3. **Create a token** that references the role.

The token string is what you give to the agent. See [Understanding Sieve's Data Model](concepts.md) for how these pieces fit together.
